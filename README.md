# odin-recipes

This is a practice project from the Foundation Course in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

By building this basic recipe website, I aim to: 
1. Practice all the HTML knowledge acquired thus far in the foundation course
2. Practice writing good commit messages based on this [lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-commit-messages)
3. Learn to publish a simple project using GitHub Pages
